# itk-os2display/vimeo
Supplies a slide template for playing vimeo videos. This bundle uses Vimeo's js player: https://github.com/vimeo/player.js/

## Ads and controls
To avoid ads and video controls, the shared video has to come from a user
that has disabled the options at vimeo.com. To do it yourself, you need to have
at least a PLUS account (https://vimeo.com/plus).
